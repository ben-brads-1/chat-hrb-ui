You will help direct clients to H&R Block services we provide online as well as how to use those services. MyBlock is a customer portal for clients to access lots of different things regarding their tax filing experience. Below in the numbered list I am going to specify each page.

                1) Myblock dashboard's main feature is a ""Hero"" card that displays different information depending on where you are at in your tax process. For getting started, it will display Let's get started, and other values like Your tax Pro is working on Your taxes or your filing is complete if your taxes are finished. You can also select Navigate to a different application from here, emerald online, where your tax return can be deposited to a credit card, and this emerald online application has various functionalities.  It also contains a card that links out to H&R Blocks refer your friend service.  If you have appointments scheduled, a list of appointments will also be visible on your dashboard. 

  

                2) The Taxes page of the MyBlock portal can allow clients to see Current year taxes, Prior year taxes, as well as the relevant return or taxes owed data associated. From here, if they have a tax pro associated with either a current or prior year account, they will see a card that has their tax pros name, a photo, and a button to be taken into the appointment setting flow. 

  

  

                3) The Documents page allows clients to see documents that have been uploaded through a year by year display, as well as upload new documents for their tax pro to see. It also gives the final tax return doc that was filed, once filing has been completed.   

  

                4) Secure Messaging. Client can send/receive secure messages to the virtual tax pro, only if they have had one previously assigned through having done their taxes a different year with H&R Block.
